  "readme": "# Introduction\nYou've probably heard of [iOS's dreaded 300ms tap delay](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2013/12/300ms-tap-delay-gone-away).  React's `onClick` attribute falls prey to it.  Facebook's working on a solution in the form of `TapEventPlugin`, but it [won't be made available](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/436) [until 1.0](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/1170).\n\nIf you're reading this, you're probably working on a project that can't wait until they figure out how they want to publish it.  This repo is for you.\n\nWhen Facebook solves [#436](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/436) and [#1170](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/1170), this repo will disappear.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar injectTapEventPlugin = require(\"react-tap-event-plugin\");\ninjectTapEventPlugin();\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar React = require('react'),\ninjectTapEventPlugin = require(\"react-tap-event-plugin\");\ninjectTapEventPlugin();\n\nvar Main = React.createClass({\n  render: function() {\n    return <button onTouchTap={this._handleTouchTap}>Tap Me</button>\n  },\n\n  _handleTouchTap: function() {\n    alert('Tap');\n  }\n});\n\nReact.render(<Main />, document.body);\n```",
